# ToDo List app by React, RTK Query & Tailwind CSS
#### [ FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BUT NOT MAINTAINED CODE (ONLY FOR DEMONSTRATION) ]

[Here is server API for this application](https://github.com/morosystems/todo-be)
###
The app has one page with a list of tasks. Any changes to the list will be reflected on the backend, which can be found at https://github.com/morosystems/todo-be (see the readme file for instructions on how to get it working).
###
The app has the following features:
* Tasks can be added.
* Tasks can be removed and renamed.
* Tasks can be marked as completed.
* Tasks can be filtered into finished and unfinished.
* All visible tasks can be marked as done at once.
* All completed tasks can be deleted at once.
* The number of completed tasks is displayed.
###
Beware of error handling when the backend for some reason does not perform the operation. If you get bored, you can continue to improve the application, for example, by introducing optimistic updates.
